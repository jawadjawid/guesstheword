# guesstheword
A multiplayer, simple, interactive, user-friendly game that challenges the players to guess the words in a N*N board. The two players take turns to guess the words in the puzzle, and who ever  guess more words wins the game. The game is developed in Python.

To play the game, open the puzzle_program.py file in a python IDE, and run it. You will be shown a list of words you need to catch
in the given N*N blob. You and another player take turns guessing the words and who ever guessies more words wins. Not just that, but some
words are more worthy to guess (give higher points) For Example guessing a backwards word is harder than a regular word, thus it gives
more point if you guess it.
